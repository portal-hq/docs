# Back up a wallet

MPC backups allow your users to recover their MPC wallets in the event that their device is lost, stolen, or is bricked.

Backups are handled in two pieces:[ user MPC backups](./#user-mpc-backups) and [custodian MPC backups](./#custodian-mpc-backups).

At the time of recovery, these two backups are **used together** to generate new shares to be stored on-device, allowing the user to migrate their wallet with a new device.

## User MPC backups

Storing a user MPC backup is done by storing an encryption key with the user's **cloud storage provider** and **the encrypted share within your infrastructure**.

In order to support user MPC backups, three main dependencies must be met:

1. You must have cloud storage configured for storing the user's share of the MPC backup.
2. Your server must be able to store the encrypted share.
3. Your mobile app must send the encrypted share to your server for storage.

### Setting up your cloud storage adapter

In order to store MPC backup shares with Portal, you must first configure one or more [cloud storage adapters](../../../../reference/react-native/storage-adapters/cloud-storage/) with your Portal instance.

You can use [@portal-hq/gdrive-storage](../../../../reference/react-native/storage-adapters/cloud-storage/portal-hq-gdrive-storage.md) or [@portal-hq/icloud-storage](../../../../reference/react-native/storage-adapters/cloud-storage/portal-hq-icloud-storage.md) (iOS only).

### **Storing encrypted shares**

On your server, create an endpoint to accept the encrypted share and store it.

<pre class="language-typescript" data-title="server.js" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-typescript">/*
 * This endpoint can be defined by you however you want
 */
app.post('/portal/clients/:clientId/backup', async (req, res) => {
<strong>  const { clientId } = req.params
</strong>  const { backupShare } = req.body
  
  // Example db function updating a "users" table with the backupShare
  await db.users.update({
    where: {
      clientId,
    },
    data: {
      backupShare,
    },
  })
  res.status(200).send()
})
</code></pre>

### **Sending shares to your server**

In order to add support for user MPC backups to your mobile app, you must perform three steps:

1. Generate an encrypted client backup share using `portal.mpc.backup`.
2. Send the resulting backup share to your API and store it.
3. Call `portal.api.storedClientBackupShare` to notify Portal that the encrypted client backup share was saved successfully. (Alternatively you can [make an HTTP request to our API](../../../../reference/custodian-api/v1-endpoints.md) directly.)

{% code title="BackupButton.tsx" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```javascript
import React, { FC } from 'react'
import { Button, View } from 'react-native'
import axios from 'axios'
import { BackupMethods, usePortal } from '@portal-hq/core'

const BackupButton: FC = () => {
  const portal = usePortal()
  
  const handleBackup = async () => {
    // Get an encryped client backup share from running backup.
    const backupShare = await portal.mpc.backup(BackupMethods.GoogleDrive)
    
    try {
      // Send the backup share to your API and store it.
      await axios.post('{your_server}/clients/[clientId]/backup', {
        data: { backupShare }
      })

      // ‚úÖ Notify Portal that the client backup share was stored! üôå
      await portal.api.storedClientBackupShare(true)
    } catch (error) {
      // ‚ùå Notify Portal that the client backup share was not stored.
      await portal.api.storedClientBackupShare(false)
    }
  }
  
  return (
    <View>
      <Button onPress={handleBackup} title="Backup your wallet" />
    </View>
  )
}

export default BackupButton
```
{% endcode %}

## Custodian MPC backups

Storing a custodian MPC backup is done by Portal generating a custodian backup share and sending the share ‚Äì  via `webhook` ‚Äì to be stored within your infrastructure.

In order to support custodian MPC backups, two main dependencies must be met:

1. Register a `webhooks_root` with Portal
2. Implement the `/{webhooks_root}/backup` route in your server to store your backup share

### Registering your webhooks\_root

You can register your `webhooks_root` via the [Portal REST API](../../../../reference/custodian-api/v1-endpoints.md#register-a-new-webhook).

### Implementing the webhook

Portal will send the custodian MPC backup share to `/{webhooks_root}/backup` via a `POST` request. The body of this `POST` request will contain two fields:

* `clientId` - The Portal `clientId` for the user&#x20;
* `share` - a `JSON.stringified` version of the backup share

{% code title="server.js" lineNumbers="true" %}
```javascript
import express from 'express'

const app = express()

app.post('/webhook/backup', async (req, res) => {
  // Destructure the provided fields from the request body
  const { 
    clientId, // The Portal clientId for the user
    share, // a JSON.strinfigied version of the backup share
  } = req.body
  
  // TODO: Store the backup share within your infrastructure
  
  res.status(200).send()
})
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When Portal makes a request to your `/backup` webhook, another immediate request is made to `/backup/fetch` in order to validate the backup share was stored successfully.
{% endhint %}

## Next steps

Now that you've successfully implemented MPC backups, your app can support [MPC recovery](../../recover-a-wallet.md).
