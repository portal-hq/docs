# Client API

The Client API is intended for use on your clients' devices to retrieve client-specific information or perform client-specific actions. This includes tasks such as fetching transaction history or simulating transactions. All Client API endpoints require either a `Client API Key` or a `Client Session Token`, which are provided upon client creation or when refreshing a client session token.
