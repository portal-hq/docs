# Cloud storage

In order to store MPC backup shares with Portal, you must first configure one or more [cloud storage adapters](./) with your Portal instance.

You can use one or more of the following cloud storage adapters within your app:&#x20;

* [@portal-hq/gdrive-storage](portal-hq-gdrive-storage.md)  - for Google Drive backup storage
* [@portal-hq/icloud-storage](portal-hq-icloud-storage.md) - for iCloud backup storage (iOS only)

A detailed breakdown of how MPC backups and recovery are configured can be seen in the [MPC Reference docs](../../../../resources/portals-mpc-architecture.md).
