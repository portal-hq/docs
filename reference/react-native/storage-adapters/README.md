# Storage adapters

As part of the MPC lifecycle, Portal stores MPC signing shares and MPC backup shares. The adapters used for this process are broken up into two categories:

* Cloud storage adapters - used to store backup shares off-device
* Mobile storage adapters - used to store signing shares on-device

Read more about your storage options for both here:
