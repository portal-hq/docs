# Custodian API

The Custodian API is designed for use on your backend servers. This API allows you to manage your clients and perform administrative actions. Every Custodian API endpoint requires the use of a `Portal API Key` (also known as a "Custodian API Key"), which can be created in the [Portal Admin Dashboard](https://app.portalhq.io/settings) under Settings in the API Keys section.

Great! Now that you have a `Portal API Key` you're ready to start using the Custodian API.
